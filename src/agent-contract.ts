export const FLOW_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = `Google Flow operations must use this MCP server's flow_* tools exclusively.

Mandatory workflow, regardless of the user's language:
1. Call flow_list_accounts. Use its defaultAccountId when it identifies a connected account; do not guess an account ID.
2. If no connected account exists, call flow_begin_account_connection. STOP and tell the user to open Flow Login Bridge in their normal Chromium, click Connect Flow, and reply when the popup says Session sent. Do not call another tool until the user replies.
3. After the user confirms the extension click, tell them a temporary Google account chooser will open and they should click the desired existing account. Then call flow_complete_account_connection with the exact connectionId returned by the begin step and userConfirmedSessionSent=true.
4. Call flow_inspect_account before generation and use only options it reports as available.
5. Call flow_generate_video or flow_generate_image for generation. Use flow_job_status, flow_upscale_video, and flow_download_job for follow-up work.

A direct user request to make, create, or generate media is explicit authorization for that requested generation, so set confirmCreditSpend=true. When the user asks what the MCP can do or how to use it, call flow_help and answer in the user's language with concrete example requests. Do not call flow_login_bridge_status during normal generation; it is only a connection diagnostic. Translate the user's intent from any language, but pass normalized model, aspect-ratio, duration, output-count, and upscale IDs exactly as flow_inspect_account reports them.

Never open, navigate, scroll, click, or automate labs.google/fx/tools/flow using generic browser, computer-use, keyboard, mouse, Playwright, or web tools. The MCP owns all Flow browser interaction. A public/marketing Flow page is not a generation workspace. If a flow_* tool reports login_required or flow_access_unavailable, stop and report that exact error or restart the begin/complete connection workflow; never compensate with browser automation. Never claim a generation started unless flow_generate_video or flow_generate_image returned a Flow job ID.`;
